Spec-004: Add new database fields for public, active and schedule
=================================================================

*Spec created:*
    2010-03-03
*Spec implemented:*
    N/A


Goals
-----

- Add ``COMCIS_PUBLIC`` setting to indicate if the installations is public
  or private. Default value should be should be ``True``. The proposed
  ``public`` field handling needs to respect this setting.

- Add ``public`` field that indicates if comic can be showed on public
  installations. All comics should have default value ``True`` and info
  loaded through ``loadmeta``. A design decision needs to be made with
  respect to if public installs should crawl "private" comics.

- Add ``active`` field that can be used to indicate that a comic is no longer
  crawled. All comics should have default value ``True`` and info loaded
  through ``loadmeta``. The status page should ignore inactive comics.

- Add ``schedule`` field to track comics schedule. This information will thus
  be moved from the crawler to the comic instance in the DB and loaded with
  ``loadmeta``. Comics without a schedule should have ``None`` as schedule.
  This change has been proposed in response to better use of the new status
  page.
