Development
***********

*comics* development is coordinated through `GitHub <http://github.com/>`_.


How to contribute
=================

The easiest way to contribute to *comics* is to register as a user at GitHub,
fork `the comics project <http://github.com/jodal/comics>`_, and start hacking.
To get your changes back into *comics*' mainline, send a pull request to `jodal
at GitHub <http://github.com/jodal>`_, or send a mail to `comics@jodal.no
<mailto:comics@jodal.no>`_. Patches accompanied by tests and documentation
gives +5 karma and kudos.

All contributions must be granted under the same license as *comics* itself.


Todo list
=========

A loosely prioritized list of things to fix. Patches accepted.

``bin/smush``
    Process images with ``bin/smush`` to reduce their size 10-20% (without
    affecting their quality) and thus reducing page load time.
``comics.aggregator.command``
    Use comic week schedule to crawl less often on non-schedule days.
``comics.core.utils.navigation``
    Unit test and refactor.


Change specifications
=====================

When planning or doing larger changes to *comics*, notes may be added to the
documentation as a *change specification*.

.. toctree::
    :glob:

    specs/*


Data model
==========

*comics*' data model is very simple. The ``core`` app consists of three models;
``Comic``, ``Release``, and ``Strip``. The ``sets`` app adds an additional
model named ``Set``. Changes to the data model are managed using `South
<http://south.aeracode.org/>`_ database migrations. If you need to change
the models, please provide the needed migrations.

The above data model diagram was generated using the Django app
`django_extensions <http://code.google.com/p/django-command-extensions/>`_ and
the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    python manage.py graph_models --settings=comics.settings.dev \
        --output=../docs/static/data_model.png --group-models \
        core sets


Running tests
=============

*comics* got some tests, but far from full test coverage. If you write new or
improved tests for *comics*' functionality it will be greatly appreciated.

To run unit tests::

    python manage.py test --settings=comics.settings.testing

To run unit tests with statement coverage::

    python manage.py test --settings=comics.settings.coverage
